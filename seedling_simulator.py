- **Shared Costs:** Initial setup costs (greenhouse, irrigation, tools) and monthly labor are treated as shared overhead for the entire nursery.
- **Production Cycles:** The model assumes fixed cycles: 4 per year for vegetables and 1 per year for trees.
- **Inputs:** All parameters can be adjusted in the sidebar on the left to simulate different scenarios.
